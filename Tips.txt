The model has been pulished in the paper:
M.Wei, W. Liu, F. Shi, Z. Jin, H. Zhang and W. Chen, "Distortion-Controllable Arc Modelling for High Impedance Arc Fault at the Distribution Network," IEEE Transactions on Power Delivery, doi: 10.1109/TPWRD.2020.2981376.

Compared to the introductions in the paper, there are two minor modifications:

1. The OFS in the first equation of Eq.(10) should be |OFS|.
2. Eq.(8) is just the concise expression. If directly using it in PSCAD, the Pres during t¡Ê[td-DUR/2, td] is not correct because the td during this interval has not been updated.
To realize it in PSCAD, the two intervals in Eq.(8) should be split into three intervals, just like the uploaded PSCAD file.
